# Prescriptable

This app was created in two weeks for our final project at Makers Academy. 

The purpose of the app is to help GPs decide which antibiotics to prescribe to their patients. 

The app was created using Swift 3 in Xcode 8, technologies we had not previously learned at Makers Academy. 

A video of our presentation is available [on Vimeo.](https://vimeo.com/203629195)
